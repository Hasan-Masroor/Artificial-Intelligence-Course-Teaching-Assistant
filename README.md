Welcome to the official repository for the Artificial Intelligence course, taught by Dr. Mahdi Javanmardi. This repository is a curated collection of educational materials designed to support students in mastering the principles and applications of AI. As the Head Teaching Assistant, my goal is to maintain and evolve this repository into a long-term, living archive that bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation.
